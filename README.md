# Movie-Recommendation-System-Using-KNN-and-Sarwar-Method

#### Project Overview
In the era of digital streaming, personalization is not just a luxury; it's a necessity. My project explores advanced methodologies in the realm of movie recommendation systems, specifically leveraging the K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and Collaborative Filtering (CF) with an emphasis on the Sarwar/Karypis Method. Utilizing the 'movielens' dataset, which comprises over 100,000 ratings across nearly 10,000 movies, I aim to enhance user satisfaction and engagement on online movie platforms through tailored recommendations.

#### Key Features

K-nearest Neighbors (KNN): Implementation of both weighted and unweighted average predictions, providing nuanced recommendations by considering similar users' preferences.
Collaborative Filtering (CF): Adoption of the Sarwar/Karypis Method for item-item recommendation, ensuring high accuracy through a sophisticated similarity measure between movies.
Data-Driven Insights: Comprehensive analysis using the 'movielens' dataset to compare the effectiveness of KNN and CF methods in real-world scenarios.
Technologies

#### Dataset: 'movielens' (ml-latest-small), featuring 100,836 ratings and 3,683 tag applications across 9,742 movies by 610 users.
Programming Languages: Primarily Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning.
Libraries and Tools: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn for machine learning; Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Getting Started
To dive into my project, I recommend following these steps:

Explore the Dataset: Familiarize yourself with the 'movielens' dataset to understand the foundation of our recommendations.

Review the Code: My project is documented thoroughly, with comments explaining the methodology, calculations, and evaluations of both KNN and CF approaches.

Execute my scripts to reproduce the findings or to experiment with different parameters (e.g., varying the value of k in KNN).

I welcome contributions from the community. Whether it's improving the code, refining the algorithms, or enhancing documentation, your input is valuable. Please refer to the contribution guidelines for more details on submitting pull requests or reporting issues.

#### Insights and Results
My research reveals intriguing patterns in movie recommendation accuracy, particularly highlighting the significance of selecting an optimal k value in KNN and demonstrating the robustness of the Sarwar/Karypis Method in CF. For detailed findings and analysis, refer to the graphs and discussion sections in my report.

#### Conclusion
This project contributes to the evolving field of recommendation systems by offering a detailed comparison of KNN and CF methods, backed by empirical data. My findings underscore the importance of careful parameter selection and methodological precision in enhancing the user experience on movie platforms.
